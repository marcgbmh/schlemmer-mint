          <summary className="cursor-pointer">What is an onchain NFT?</summary>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Key characteristics of onchain NFTs are:
            <br />
            - Assets and metadata are stored on the blockchain, not on external
            servers or IPFS
            <br />
            - Smart contracts that generate the NFTs are also stored on-chain
            <br />
            - All data is accessible as long as the blockchain is operational
            <br />- Eliminates reliance on external systems or third parties
          </p>

        <details className="p-4 rounded-lg">
          <summary className="cursor-pointer">Wen Reveal?</summary>
          <p className="mt-2">
            The Smart Contract has a commit-reveal scheme (similar to Checks VV)
            whereby the reveal happens after the next person mints, or after ~32
            blocks on Ethereum. Be patient, reload metadata. Enjoy the art -
            donâ€™t worry, it will persist forever.
